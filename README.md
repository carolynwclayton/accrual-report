# accrual-report
This accrual report example is adapted from work I did consulting for the School of Pharmacy at the University of Colorado Denver. Data that can be used to create this report from scratch will be uploaded once I generate some example data.

The R files for this report are the read-in file and the report file. The read-in file is used to import REDCAP datasets and determines which dataset in the working directory is the most recent. The report file generates the accrual PDF and includes some summary statistics and data visualizations.
